Welcome to my perfil, a self-taught developer.

My interest is to learn as much computer science as I can. Although I have little knowledge about most stuff, I've worked on tons of small and diverse projects and played around with lots of cool tools in the past, and I'm eager to do & learn more!

I also like creating projects with new people.
